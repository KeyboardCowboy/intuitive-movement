## Hosting Recommendations

Based on the project brief mentioning Static.run, here are hosting options:

1. **Static.run** - Free static hosting
2. **GitHub Pages** - Free, integrates with version control
3. **Netlify** - Free tier with easy deployment
4. **Vercel** - Fast, modern hosting platform

All of these services work perfectly with this simple HTML/CSS/JS website.

## Troubleshooting

### CSS Not Loading (MIME Type Error)
If you see an error like "Refused to apply style... MIME type 'application/xml' is not supported":

**For Static.run (Current Setup):**
- âœ… **Fixed**: CSS file renamed from `style.css` to `styles.css`
- âœ… **HTML Updated**: Now references `styles.css` instead of `style.css`
- Upload the new files and the styling should work correctly

**For Other Hosting Providers:**
- **Netlify/Vercel**: Should work automatically with either filename
- **GitHub Pages**: Should work automatically  
- **cPanel/shared hosting**: May need server configuration

**If Issues Persist:**
1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Try uploading through the hosting provider's file manager instead of FTP
3. Check that the file uploaded successfully and isn't corrupted
4. Verify the CSS file URL loads directly in the browser

### Contact Form Not Working
- The form opens the user's default email client
- If this doesn't work, they can manually email `tony@intuitivemovement.biz`
- For a server-side contact form, you'll need backend processing

### Mobile Menu Not Responding
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in the browser
- Ensure `script.js` is loading without errors in the browser console
